# README for Identifying Annotator Disagreement Offensive Text Classification: A Graph-Based Clustering Approach

## Introduction

This repository contains the code, datasets, and outputs related to the research on the project Identifying Annotator Disagreement Offensive Text Classification: A Graph-Based Clustering Approach. The repository is systematically organised. 
Follow the sequence of steps detailed in each Jupyter notebook. Start with `Step1_inputs` and `Step_1_Preprocessing_data_and_EDA.ipynb` and proceed in numerical order and view outputs.

## File and Folder Structure

### Folders

  
- **Step1_inputs**: Contains the raw datasets that are used in the first step of analysis - download these datasets to start with.
  
- **Step1_outputs**: Contains the datasets that result from the first step. These are the cleaned and transformed datasets ready for Step 2.
  
- **Step2_outputs**: Includes datasets and outputs that are the outcomes of the second step, which deals with calculating disagreement metrics and clustering and ready for Step 3.
  
- **Step3_outputs**: Stores the final datasets and other outputs generated during the third step, focused on BERT based classification models.

- **Explored_code**: This folder contains initial code and experiments that were conducted during the early stages of the project. It serves as an archive for some of the work attempted at the start but not taken further or earlier versions of current work.

  
  
### Files

- **Step_1_Preprocessing_data_and_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code, comments, and visualisations for the first step, which is data preprocessing and EDA of raw datasets.
  
- **Step_2_calculating_diasgreement_and_clustering.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook detailing the second step of the project that involves calculating disagreement metrics among annotators and clustering of annotators.
  
- **Step_3_Classification_models.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that contains code for the various BERT based classification model tested in the final stage of analysis.
  
- **Step_4_Error_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for error analysis post-classification, providing insights into the shortcomings of best performing model.
